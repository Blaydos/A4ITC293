            <p>
                Iâ€™m Slayde Bymonds, a web development student passionate about creating modern, responsive, and accessible digital experiences. This portfolio website was built to demonstrate my practical skills in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and to present my professional strengths to potential employers in the renewable energy and tech sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Solar Panel Co. theme was chosen as part of an academic assignment, aligning my technical presentation with a fictional company scenario. All content has been custom created for educational purposes and structured to highlight industry-relevant skills such as communication, problem solving, and technical execution.
